# Computer Science for AI - Problem Solutions 

Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the Harvard 'Professional Certificate: Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence' program.   
in particular the program is split in two main courses, CS50: Introduction to Computer Science and CS50AI: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my solutions to the problem sets and projects provided in these courses.
